-> Today's task i watch and learn from today's SQL videos as per schedule given by,

-> View limitations,
	1) You cannot pass parameters to SQL Server views
	2) Cannot use an Order By clause with views without specifying FOR XML or TOP
	3) Views cannot be created on Temporary Tables
	4) You cannot associate rules and defaults with views

-> Trigger
	- A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs.
	- There are three types of trigger,
		1) DML triggers
			- AFTER Triggers = After triggers,fires after the triggering action.
			- Instead of Triggers = Instead of triggers,fires instead of the triggering action(Instead of insert trigger,Instead of update triggers,Instead of delete triggers)
		2) DDL triggers
		3) Logon triggers

-> Derived tables and common table expressions,
	- common table expressions(CTE) is introducedin SQL server 2005.A CTE is a temporary result set,that can be referenced within a SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE or DELETE statement,that immediately follows the CTE.

-> Updatable common table expressions,
	- if a CTE is created on one base table,then it is possible to UPDATE the CTE,which in turn will update the underlying base table.
	- if a CTE is created on more than one table,and if the UPDATE affects only one base table,then the UPDATE is allowed.
	- if a CTE is based on multiple tables,and if the UPDATE statement affects more than 1 base table table,then the UPDATE is not allowed.

-> Database normalization,
	- Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes of the database to reduce or eliminate data redundancy.
	- First Normal Form(1NF) = If a relation contain composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates first normal form or a relation is in first normal form if it does not contain any composite or multi-valued attribute. A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute.
	- Second Normal Form(2NF) = To be in second normal form, a relation must be in first normal form and relation must not contain any partial dependency. 
	- Third Normal Form(3NF) = A relation is in third normal form, if there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes as well as it is in second normal form.
