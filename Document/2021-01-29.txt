-> Today i watch and learn from videos about
	abstract classes
	difference between abstract class and interface
	Problems of multiple class inheritance
	Multiple class inheritance using interfaces
	Delegates usage in c#
	Multicast Delegates in C#
-> A delegate is type safe function pointer that holds a refernce to a function.
-> for code reduce lambda expression is use for delegate.
-> multicast delegate is a delegae that has references to more thanone function.
	two approaches to create multicast delegate
	=> + or += to register method with the delegate
	=> - or -= to unregister method with the delegate
-> i learnand practice above videos and create another console app
-> in that i have practice,
	-inheritance
	-structure
	-interface
	-abstract class
	-multiple class inheritance using interfaces
	-delegate
	-multicast delegate.
