-> Today's task i watch and learn from today's ASP.net videos as per schedule given by,

-> What is ASP.NET,
	-ASP.NET is a Web application framework developed by Microsoft to build dynamic data driven Web applications and Web services. 
		1. ASP.NET is a subset of .NET framework. In simple terms a framework is a collection of classes. 
		2. ASP.NET is the successor to classic ASP (Active Server Pages).

-> What is viewstate,
	-ViewState data is serialized into base64-encoded strings, and is stored in Hidden input field __ViewState.
	-To view this hidden input field, right click on the browser and select "View Page Source" for google chrome. In internet explorer, right click and select "View Source".

-> Events in the life cycle of a web application,
	-In a web application, events can occur at 3 levels
		1. At the Application Level(Example: Application Start)
		2. At the Page Level(Example: Page Load)
		3. At the Control Level (Example: Button Click)

-> Difference between ViewState, SessionState and ApplicationState,
	-ViewState:
		1. ViewState of a webform is available only with in that webform
		2. ViewState is stored on the page in a hidden field called _ViewState. Because of this, the ViewState, will be lost, if you navigate awaya from the page, or if the broswer is closed.
		3. ViewState is used by all asp.net controls to retain their state across postback
	-Session State:
		1. Session state variables are available across all pages, but only for a given single session. Session variables are like single-user global data.
		2. Session state variables are stored on the web server.
		3. SessionState variables are cleared, when the user session times out. The default is 20 minutes. This is configurable in web.config
	-Application State:
		1. Application State variables are available across all pages and across all sessions. Application State variables are like multi-user global data.
		2. Application State variables are stored on the web server.
		3. Application State variables are cleared, when the process hosting the application is restarted.
	

-> ASP.NET Page Life Cycle Events,
		1.PreInit
		2.Init 
		3.InitComplete 
		4.PreLoad 
		5.Load 
		6.Control Events
		7.Load Complete
		8.PreRender
		9.PreRenderComplete
		10.Unload 
		11.Error 

-> ASP.NET Server control events,
	-Postback events - These events submit the Web page, immediately to the server for processing. Click event of a button control is an example for PostBack event.
	-Cached events - These events are saved in the pageâ€™s view state to be processed when a postback event occurs. TextChanged event of TextBox control, and SelectedIndexChanged event of a DropDownList control are examples of cached events. Cached events can be converted into postback events, by setting the AutoPostBack property of the control to true.
	-Validation events - These events occur on the client, before the page is posted back to the server. All validation controls use these type of events.

-> IsPostBack,
	-IsPostBack is a Page level property, that can be used to determine whether the page is being loaded in response to a client postback, or if it is being loaded and accessed for the first time.

-> IIS - Internet Information Services and ASP.NET,
	-IIS is a web server that can be used to run asp.net web applications.
	-Visual Studio ships with a built-in web server. If you want to just build and test web applications on your machine, you don't need an IIS.
	-Built-in web server will not serve requests to another computer. By default, visual studio uses the built-in web server.

-> ASP.NET TextBox Control,
	-The TextBox control is used to get the input from the user of the web application.
	-Properties of a TextBox control,
		-TextMode,Text ,MaxLength ,ReadOnly ,ToolTip ,Columns ,Height ,Width ,AutoPostBack.
	-Events of TextBox:
		-TextChanged- This event is fired, when the text is changed.
	-Methods of a TextBox:
		-Focus - Set input focus onto the control.

-> ASP.NET Radio Button Control,
	-Radio Button control is used, when you want the user to select only one option from the available choices.
	-Properties,
		-Checked ,Text ,TextAlign ,Group Name,AutoPostBack.
	-Events:
		-CheckedChanged - This event is fired when the checked status of the radio button control is changed.

-> ASP.NET CheckBox Control,
	-CheckBox Control is used, when you want the user to select more than one option from the available choices.
	-Properties,
		-Checked ,Text ,TextAlign ,AutoPostBack.
	-Methods:Focus() 
	-Events:CheckedChanged

-> ASP.NET Button, LinkButton and ImageButton Controls,
	1. Button - The Button control is used to display a push button. Use the Text property to change the Text on the Button control.
	2. LinkButton - LinkButton displays the button like a HyperLink. Use the Text property to change the LinkText.
	3. ImageButton - ImageButton provides the flexibility of associating an Image with the button, using the ImageURL property.

-> Command Event of an asp.net button control,
	-ASP.NET button control exposes 2 events - Click and Command events.
	-Click event happens before the Command event. 
	-The click event handler and the command event handlers, are attached to the respective Click and Command events in the HTML using onclick and oncommand attributes. 
	-If you have multiple button controls on a webform, and if you want to programmatically determine which Button control is clicked, we can make use of Command event, along with CommandName and CommandArgument properties.

-> Dropdownlist in asp.net,
	-A DropDownList is a collection of ListItem objects.
	-To add items to the DropDownList,
		1. Adding items to the DropDownList control at design time using the HTML
		2. Adding items to the DropDownList control at runtime using the code
