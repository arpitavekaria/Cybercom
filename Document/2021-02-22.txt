-> Today's task i watch and learn from today's ADO.net videos as per schedule given by,

-> What is ADO.NET,
	- ADO.NET stands for ActiveX Data Object is a database access technology created by Microsoft as part of its .NET framework that can access any kind of data source.
	- Itâ€™s a set of object-oriented classes that provides a rich set of data components to create high-performance, reliable and scalable database applications for client- server applications as well as distributed environments over the Internet and intranets.
	- the following are, a few of the different types of .NET applications that use ADO>NET to connect to a database,excecute commands, and retrieve data.
		-ASP.NET web Applications
		-Windows Applications
		-Console Applications

-> SqlConnection,
	- SqlConnection and SqlCommand are classes of a connected architecture and found in the System.Data.SqlClient namespace.
	- The SqlConnection class makes a connection with the database.this connection is used by the SqlCommand to work with that database. 
	- SqlCommand class is used to execute the SQL statements. 
	- Here,two important methods of SqlConnection.
		-Open() : The open() method  is used to open the Database connection.
		-Close() : The close() method is used to close the Database connection.

-> ConnectionStrings in web.config configuration file,
	-In an asp.net web application, the configuration strings can be stored in web.config file
	-Use the ConnectionStrings property of the ConfigurationManager class to retrieve the connection string value from web.config. 
	-ConfigurationManager class is present in System.Configuration namespace.

-> SqlCommand,
	-The main role of SqlCommand is to execute SQL statements.
	-SqlCommand Properties,
		-CommandText: The commandText property is used to set the SQL statement.
		-Connection: This property is used to get connection to the database source which is specified in SqlConnection. 
	-SqlCommand Method,
		-ExecuteReader() : The ExecuteReader() method can return a set of records from a database. 
		-ExecuteNonQuery() : The ExecuteNonQuery() method does not return any record.It only returns the number of affected rows.
 		-ExecuteScalar() : The ExecuteScalar() returns a single value from the database. Generally, it is used with an aggregate function.

-> Sql injection and prevention,
	-SQL Injection is a type of an injection attack that makes it possible to execute malicious SQL statements.
	-These statements control a database server behind a web application. 
	-The only sure way to prevent SQL Injection attacks is input validation and parametrized queries and stored procedure.

-> SqlDataReader,
	-The ADO.NET DataReader is used to retrieve read-only and forward-only data from a database. 
	-Using of a DataReader increases application performance and reduces system overheads. This is due to one row at a time is stored in memory. 
	-Instance of SqlDataReader cannot be created by using the new operator.
	-The SqlCommand object's ExecuteReader() method creates and returns an instance of SqlDataReader.  
	-The data is available as long as the connection with database exists.
	-You need to open and close the connecton manually in code.

-> SqlDataReader object's NextResult method,
	-The NextResult() method returns true and advances to the next result-set. 
	-The SqlDataReader object's Read() method is used to loop thru the rows in a given result set, where as the NextResult() method is used to loop thru multiple  result sets.

-> SqlDataAdapter and DataSet,,
	-SqlDataAdapter and Dataset provides us with disconnected data access model.
	-The DataAdapter object serves as a conduit between the data source and the Dataset. 
	-The DataAdapter knows about the DataSet and it knows how to populate it. 
	-The Adapter also knows about the connection to the data source.
	-DataAdapter.Fill Method,
		-The Fill method retrieves rows from the data source using the SELECT statement specified by an associated SelectCommand property.
		-Adds or refreshes rows in the DataSet to match those in the data source using the DataSet name, and creates a DataTable named "Table".
