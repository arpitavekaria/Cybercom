	- instance of class
	- constructor - State & Behaviour
	- distructor
	- static mamber & Object
	- Method Overriding
	- Method OverLoding
	- Method Hinding
	- Polymorphism
=>  If we use static keyword in object then we can use name of the class
=>  In short static member use the name of the class and intance members invoke using instance or object of the class
=>  We not use access modifier in static constructor also use initialize static fields
=>  if we not give any access modifier of class name then it's by default private
=>  In inheritance multiple inheritance not support in C# other all supports in C#
=>  Polymorphism - in derived class any method of derived class override use virtual method and we use override keyword in override method
=>  Polymorphism enable are to invoke derived class method using a base class reference variable at run time this a polymorphism
=>  In overriding we use virtual method for base class and use override keyword in Derived class, and method hinding we use new keyword in derived class
=>  In method overriding we use base class reference variable pointing to child class object
=>  In method overloading we can use same method name but different type of parameter or different argument
