-> In Today's video i watch and learn,
	- Difference between Convert ToString and ToString
	- Difference between String and StringBuilder
	- The use of Partial class or structure using partial keyword
	- The use of Partial Method 
	- Indexser
	- Overloading indexers
	- Optional parameters
	- Making method parameters optional using method overloading
	- Making method parameters optional by specifying parameter defaults
	- Making method parameters optional by using OptionalAttribute
	- Code snippets
	- Dictionary
	- List collection class

-> System.String is immutable and StringBuilder is Mutable.
-> In immutable string is not change after created but the Mutable string is modified/changeble string

-> Partial class is provide to single class into multipal files and all these files are combine to compile time
-> The partial keyword is also used to split struct or interface into two or more files.

->The partial method is only teo part 
	    - Defination
	    - Implimentation
-> The use of partial method do not multipal imlimentating declarations
-> If we can not a impliment method then the C# complier is ignore that Method
-> This is by default private and we can not use any access modifires
-> Also use return type void because it's not any type of return in defination

-> There are two types of indexer. 1) int indexer and 2) string indexer
-> using the indexser we can create special property just like geet and set, the get-set also use in indexer
-> It can use create with this keyword

-> We can use this ways to use optional method.
	- Using parameter param keyword
	- by specifying parameter defaults
	- And using in optionalAttribute

-> Dictionary
	- Dictionary is a collection of key, value pairs.
	- It is provides fast lookups for value using keys.
	- The Key in dictionary must be unique
	- In dictionary TryGetValue(), Count(), Remove(), Clear(), Convert in to array

-> Collection class
	- The List of Collection Class in functions is Contains(), Exists(), Find(), FindLast(), FindAll(), FindIndex(), FindLastIndex, Convert array to list,list to array and list to dictionary

-> Created one Console App for practice from above topics.
