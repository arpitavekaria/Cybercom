-> Multithreading
	- Process = it is what the operating system used to facilitate the excecution of the program by providing the resources required.
	- Thread = Threads are lightweight processes.

-> Advantages and disadvantages of multithreading
	- Advantages:
		1)To maintain a responsive user interface.
		2)To make an efficient use of processor time, while waiting I/O operation to complete.
		3)To split large CPU- bound task to be processed simultaneously on a machine, which has multiple processors/cores. 4)Different processors execute different thread simultaneously, so performance improves.

	- Diadvantages:
		1)If the machine is single processor/cores, then the multithreading causes the overhead over the processor, as it is using context switching
		2)you have to write more lines of code. Multithreaded Applications are difficult to write, understand, debug and maintain.

-> ThreadStart delegate
	- This represents the method that should be executed on a thread.This delegate is passed to the Thread constructor.This method is not called until the Thread.Start method is called

-> ParameterizedThreadStart delegate
	- Use ParameterizedThreadStart delegate to pass data to the thread function.(type safety looses)

-> Passing data to the Thread function in a type safe manner
	- Encapsulate the thread function and the data it needs in the helper classand use the threadstart delegate to execute the thread function.

-> Retrieving data from Thread function using callback method
-> Significance of Thread.Join and Thread.IsAlive functions 

-> Protecting shared resources from concurrent access in multithreading
	- From a performance perspective using interlocked class is better over using locking

-> Difference between Monitor and lock
	- Both moniter class and lock provides a mechanism that synchronizes access to objects. lock is the shortcut for Moniter.Enter with try and finally.

-> Deadlock in a multithreaded program and how to resolve it.
	- two threads never give up their locks,hence a deadlock

-> Performance of a multithreaded program
	- on a machine that has multiple processors,multiplle threads can excecute application code in parallel on different cores.
	- on a machine that has single processors,multiplle threads can excecute, one after the other or wait until one thread finishes.

-> Anonymous methods
	- Anonymous methods is a method without a name. they provide us a way of creating delegate instances without having to write a separate method.
	
-> Lambda expression,Func delegate,Async and await. 
-> Created one Console App for practice from above topics.
