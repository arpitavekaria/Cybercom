-> Today's task i watch and learn from today's SQL videos as per schedule given by,

-> In today i watched and learn,
	- Self join
	- Different ways to replace NULL 
	- Coalesce function
	- Union and union all
	- Stored procedures
	- Stored procedures with output parameters
	- Stored procedure output parameters or return values
	- Advantages of stored procedures
	- Built in string functions
	- LEFT, RIGHT, CHARINDEX and SUBSTRING functions
	- Replicate, Space, Patindex, Replace and Stuff string functions
	- DateTime functions
	- IsDate, Day, Month, Year and DateName DateTime functions
	- DatePart, DateAdd and DateDiff functions

-> COALESCE() function returns the first non null value.
-> UNION and UNION ALL operators are used to combine the result set of two or more SELECT queries.
-> A stored procedure is group of transact SQL statements.
-> To encrypt the text of stored procedure,use WITH ENCRYPTION option.it is not possible to view the text of an encrypted SP.
-> To create an SP with output parameter,we use the keyword OUT or OUTPUT.

-> Advantages of SP
	- Execution plan retention and reusability.
	- Reduce network traffic
	- Code reusability and better maintainability
	- Better Security
	- Avoids SQL injection attack
 
-> String functions -- ASCII(),CHAR(),LTRIM(),RTRIM(),LOWER(),UPPER(),REVERSE(),LEN()
-> Commonly used built in functions -- LEFT(),RIGHT(),CHARINDEX(),SUBSTRING()
-> Also more funtions -- Replicate(),Space(),Patindex(),Replace(),Stuff()
-> DateTime functions -- IsDate(),Day(),Month(),Year(),DateName()
-> Also more functions -- DatePart(),DateAdd(),DateDiff()
-> Also fire queries in MS-SQL server 2012 from above concepts.
